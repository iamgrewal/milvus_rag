# Test Suite for RAGSystem

## Overview
This file contains a unit test suite for the `RAGSystem` class, which is part of the `graphrag` library. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the `ingest` and `answer` methods of the `RAGSystem` class, ensuring that the system correctly processes and retrieves information based on ingested documents.

## Key Components
- **TestRAGSystem Class**: This class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains the test methods for the `RAGSystem` class.
  - **setUp Method**: This method is called before each test. It initializes an instance of `RAGSystem` that can be used in the tests.
  - **test_ingest_and_answer Method**: This test verifies that the `RAGSystem` can ingest a document and correctly answer a query about that document. It checks that the related entities are correctly identified and that the answer to the query is accurate.

## Dependencies
This test file imports the `RAGSystem` class from `graphrag/rag_system/main.py`. It is important to ensure that the `RAGSystem` class is functioning correctly, as the tests depend on its implementation.

## Usage Examples
To run the tests in this file, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_rag_system.py
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `RAGSystem` class is thoroughly tested with various documents and queries to cover edge cases.
- Keep the test cases isolated and independent to avoid side effects between tests.
- Regularly run the test suite after making changes to the `RAGSystem` class to ensure that no functionality is broken.
