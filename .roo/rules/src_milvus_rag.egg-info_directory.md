# Overview of src/milvus_rag.egg-info

The `src/milvus_rag.egg-info` directory is a standard directory created by Python's packaging tools. It contains metadata about the `milvus_rag` package, which is essential for package distribution and installation.

## Key Files

- **PKG-INFO**: This file contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, author, and other relevant information. It is crucial for package management systems to understand the package's details and dependencies.

## Relation to Other Parts of the Codebase

This directory is typically generated when the package is built or installed. It does not contain any source code or modules but serves as a reference for tools that manage the package lifecycle. It is important for developers to understand that while this directory is part of the package structure, it does not directly interact with the code in the `src` directory.

## Common Patterns and Conventions

- The `egg-info` directory is automatically generated by tools like setuptools or pip when a package is created or installed. Developers should not manually edit files in this directory, as they are managed by the packaging tools.
- The naming convention for this directory follows the pattern `<package_name>.egg-info`, which helps in identifying the metadata for specific packages.

## Best Practices

- **Do not modify**: Avoid making manual changes to the files in this directory. Instead, update your package's setup configuration (e.g., `setup.py`) and regenerate the metadata using the appropriate packaging commands.
- **Version control**: While the `egg-info` directory is often included in `.gitignore` files, ensure that your versioning and packaging practices are consistent to avoid discrepancies in package metadata.
- **Documentation**: Keep your package documentation up to date, as the information in `PKG-INFO` should reflect the current state of your package, including any dependencies or changes in functionality.
