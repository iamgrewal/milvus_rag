# Test Suite for NLPProcessor

## Overview
This file contains a set of unit tests for the `NLPProcessor` class, which is part of the `graphrag.nlp.processor` module. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the text preprocessing and entity extraction methods within the `NLPProcessor` class.

## Key Components

### TestNLPProcessor Class
- **Inheritance**: This class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, allowing it to utilize the built-in testing framework provided by Python.
- **setUp Method**: This method is called before each test. It initializes an instance of `NLPProcessor`, which is used in the subsequent tests.

### Test Methods
1. **test_preprocess**:  
   - **Purpose**: Tests the `preprocess` method of the `NLPProcessor` class. 
   - **Functionality**: It checks that the word 'was' is removed from the input text 'Apple was founded in 1976.' after preprocessing.
   - **Assertion**: Uses `assertNotIn` to ensure 'was' is not present in the processed output.

2. **test_entity_extraction**:  
   - **Purpose**: Tests the `extract_entities_and_relations` method of the `NLPProcessor` class. 
   - **Functionality**: It verifies that the entities 'Steve Jobs' and 'Apple' are correctly identified in the input text 'Steve Jobs founded Apple.'
   - **Assertions**: Uses `assertIn` to check that both entities are present in the extracted results.

## Dependencies
This test file imports the `NLPProcessor` class from the `graphrag.nlp.processor` module. It is essential to ensure that the `NLPProcessor` is correctly implemented and accessible for these tests to run successfully. 

## Usage Examples
To run the tests in this file, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_nlp_processor.py
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `NLPProcessor` class is thoroughly tested with various input scenarios to cover edge cases.
- Keep the test cases updated as the functionality of the `NLPProcessor` evolves.
- Use descriptive names for test methods to clearly indicate what functionality is being tested.
