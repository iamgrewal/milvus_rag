## Relation to Other Parts of the Codebase
The files in this directory are integral to the overall architecture of the codebase, providing necessary configurations and documentation that support various components. They help ensure that developers have a clear understanding of how to implement and utilize different functionalities effectively.

## Common Patterns and Conventions
- Each MDC file is named to reflect its purpose, often prefixed with a number to indicate its order or priority.
- The content within each file follows a consistent structure, typically starting with an overview, followed by detailed guidelines and examples.

## Best Practices
- Always refer to the relevant MDC file when implementing features related to the documented functionality.
- Keep the documentation up to date with any changes in the codebase to ensure accuracy.
- Use clear and concise language to make the documentation accessible to all developers, regardless of their experience level.
- Follow the naming conventions and file organization to maintain consistency across the directory.
