# Overview
The `encrypt_key2.py` file is responsible for encrypting a plaintext key using the Fernet symmetric encryption method provided by the `cryptography` library. This is useful for securely storing sensitive information such as API keys or passwords.

# Key Components
- **Imports**: The file imports the `os` module to access environment variables and the `Fernet` class from the `cryptography.fernet` module to perform encryption.
- **Fernet Instance**: An instance of `Fernet` is created using an encryption key retrieved from the environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- **Plain Key**: The variable `plain_key` holds the plaintext key that needs to be encrypted. In this example, it is a placeholder string.
- **Encryption**: The `fernet.encrypt()` method is called to encrypt the `plain_key`, and the result is printed in a decoded format.

# Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository and is not imported by any other files. It operates independently, relying solely on the `cryptography` library and the environment variable for its functionality.

# Usage Example
To use this script, ensure that the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable is set to a valid Fernet key. You can run the script in a terminal or command prompt:
```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEY='your-fernet-key'
python encrypt_key2.py
```
This will output the encrypted version of the `plain_key`.

# Best Practices
- **Environment Variables**: Always store sensitive keys in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your scripts to enhance security.
- **Key Management**: Regularly rotate your encryption keys and ensure that old keys are securely destroyed to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to manage cases where the environment variable is not set or the encryption process fails.
