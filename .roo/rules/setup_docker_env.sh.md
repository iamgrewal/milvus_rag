# setup_docker_env.sh Documentation

## Overview
The `setup_docker_env.sh` script automates the setup of a Docker environment for the project. It creates necessary configuration files such as `.env`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `docker-compose.yml` to facilitate the deployment of the application using Docker containers.

## Key Components
- **.env File**: This file contains environment variables required for the application, including configurations for Milvus and Neo4j services.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image for the application, specifying the base image, working directory, dependencies, and the command to run the application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the application, ensuring that all dependencies are installed in the Docker container.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configures the multi-container Docker application, defining services for Milvus, Neo4j, and the application itself, along with their dependencies and environment settings.

## Dependencies
This script does not import or depend on any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a setup script for the Docker environment.

## Usage
To use this script, simply run it in a terminal:
```bash
bash setup_docker_env.sh
```
This will create all necessary files in the current directory, allowing you to build and run the Docker containers using the generated `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine before running this script.
- Review the generated `.env` file to customize any environment variables as needed for your local setup.
- Regularly update the `requirements.txt` file to include any new dependencies as your project evolves.
- Use version control to track changes to the generated files, especially if you modify the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`.
