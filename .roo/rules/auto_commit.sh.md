# auto_commit.sh Documentation

## Overview
The `auto_commit.sh` script is a Bash script designed to automate the process of staging and committing changes in a Git repository. It simplifies the workflow for developers by allowing them to quickly stage all changes and commit them without manually entering Git commands.

## Key Components

### Functions
- **stage_and_commit**: This function is responsible for staging all changes in the current directory using `git add .` and then outputs a message indicating that the changes have been staged and committed. The actual commit is handled by a pre-commit hook, which is a Git feature that allows for automated actions before a commit is finalized.

### Main Execution
- The script starts by printing a message to the console indicating that it is staging and committing changes. It then calls the `stage_and_commit` function to perform the staging and committing actions.

## Dependencies
This script does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It operates independently, relying solely on the Git command-line interface.

## Usage Example
To use this script, simply run it from the command line in the root directory of your Git repository:
```bash
bash auto_commit.sh
```
This will stage all changes and commit them automatically, assuming that a pre-commit hook is set up to handle the commit process.

## Best Practices
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Ensure that you have a pre-commit hook configured in your Git repository to handle the actual commit process. This can include running tests, linters, or other checks before finalizing the commit.
- **Review Changes**: Before running this script, it is advisable to review the changes that will be staged and committed to avoid committing unintended modifications.
- **Use with Caution**: Automating commits can lead to unintended consequences if not monitored. Use this script in environments where you are confident about the changes being made.
