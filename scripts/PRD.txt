Based on a comprehensive review and de-duplication of the provided artifacts—including the primary technical specification, architectural documentation, and pseudocode extracts from the .pdf, .docx, and .txt files—I have consolidated a production-ready technical and implementation blueprint for the rhoSearcher system.

This merged specification removes redundant content, harmonizes architectural interpretations, and integrates both practical guidance and implementation clarity across all development layers.

📘 Consolidated Technical Requirements and Implementation Blueprint

Project Title:

rhoSearcher — Autonomous Research Agent System

Core Capabilities:
	•	Semantic + graph-based retrieval with fusion
	•	Self-correcting autonomous agents
	•	Multi-source research orchestration
	•	Structured, citation-backed reporting

⸻

2. Business Objectives
	•	Speed: Automate exhaustive online research
	•	Quality: Improve information accuracy and contextual synthesis
	•	Credibility: Ensure source traceability and APA citation
	•	Scalability: Serve thousands of concurrent tasks
	•	Persona-alignment: Support for sales, legal, academic, and strategic researchers

3. Scope

✅ In-Scope
	•	Multi-agent orchestration (Planner, Executor, Publisher)
	•	Hybrid retrieval: Milvus (vector) + Neo4j (graph)
	•	Fusion logic and reranking (RRF, BERTScore, etc.)
	•	Fallback via APIs (Exa.ai, Perplexity)
	•	Source-linked PDF/Markdown reports
	•	Web interface for task creation and result visualization

Stage 2
	•	Real-time conversational UX
	•	Continuous learning or live user training cycles

	1.	User inputs a high-level research topic.
	2.	Planner Agent breaks topic into research questions.
	3.	Executor Agents retrieve results using:
	•	Neo4j (graph context)
	•	Milvus (vector similarity)
	•	External APIs if fallback is triggered
	4.	Fusion Engine merges and ranks results.
	5.	Self-Correction detects hallucinated or low-confidence outputs.
	6.	Publisher Agent generates APA-cited PDF or Markdown report.
